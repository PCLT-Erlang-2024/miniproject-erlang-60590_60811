To run this task, use the same method as task 1 and 2.

For this task, we decided to use the code from task 2 as a 
foundation to implement the newly required functionalities.

To implement non-instant trucks, communication must be done
both ways between conveyors and trucks, however one process
must be spawned befored the other, so it's impossible to
pass the pid of the other in the arguments of the respective
function. To deal with this problem, when the conveyor belt
receives a package record, it will create a new record,
the first field contains it's Pid, while the second field
contains the package from the producer.

Using the conveyor Pid, the truck can signal it with a "wait"
message, and once the replacement is finished it will send
a "restart" to resume package processing.

After receiving a "wait" signal, the conveyor will change 
state internally, and will stop reading other messages, such
as the packages from the producer, and is expecting a "restart"
message from the truck process, which will change the internally,
once more, to the default state.
