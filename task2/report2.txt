To run this task, use the same method as task1.

For task 2, we decided to use the code from task 1 as a 
foundation to implement the newly required functionalities.

To implement different sized packages, we decided that the
producer function will generate a package with a random 
integer size ranging from 1 to the maximum capacity of the
trucks (inclusive).

As previously stated, in the task1 report, the case where
the capacity of a truck would be exceeded with a new package
was already implement and remains unchanged, however, in the
circumstances of task 2 onwards, this case is more likely to 
happen, as packages will differ in sizes.
